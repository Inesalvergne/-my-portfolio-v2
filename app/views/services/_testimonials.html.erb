          <h3>A lot of strong skills ‚ú®</h3>
          <p>"Having worked with Ines for a few years, I can say that she has a lot of strong skills:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Very good at design; has a critical eye for colour schemes, UI, UX; is very efficient with Figma</li>
            <li>Great at front-end implementation</li>
            <li>Very good in back-end logic and implementation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I would gladly recommend Ines üëåüèª"</p>

            A strong UI/UX designer, she helped us greatly improve the visual aspect of the platform. And yet, it was on
            the back-end that she shipped the most. Put simply, there's nothing she can't do."</p>

            for sites that puts transparency and usability first and does not sacrifice aesthetics. She was very easy to
            work with, and I'm happy to say she pushed my team to find the best solution to various design issues."

            supported us in coming to our own conclusions. She seems like a real expert in the topic,
